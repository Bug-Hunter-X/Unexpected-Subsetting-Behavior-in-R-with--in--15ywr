This repository demonstrates an uncommon but potentially problematic issue when subsetting data frames in R using the `%in%` operator.  When attempting to select rows based on values that are not present in the relevant column, the result might be counter-intuitive.  The provided example illustrates the behavior and offers a solution to handle such scenarios more robustly.
